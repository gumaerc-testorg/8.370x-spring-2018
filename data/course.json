  "course_description": "This course is a three-course series that provides an introduction to the theory and practice of quantum computation.\u00a0The three-course series comprises:\n\n{{% resource_link \"bf471999-c54c-4c8d-a26b-5facb2df3b5f\" \"8.370.1x\" %}}: Foundations of Quantum and Classical computing\u2014quantum mechanics, reversible computation, and quantum measurement  \n{{% resource_link \"de7a94ba-40ec-4edb-8484-a0efb4ad985d\" \"8.370.2x\" %}}: Simple Quantum Protocols and Algorithms\u2014teleportation and superdense coding, the Deutsch-Jozsa and Simon\u2019s algorithm, Grover\u2019s quantum search algorithm, and Shor\u2019s quantum factoring algorithm  \n{{% resource_link \"27d9a5c7-85a7-4bb8-98b1-61321a770e2e\" \"8.370.3x\" %}}: Foundations of Quantum communication\u2014noise and quantum channels, and quantum key distribution\n\nPrior knowledge of quantum mechanics is helpful but not required. It is best if you know some linear algebra.\n\nThis course was organized as a three-part series on {{% resource_link \"e3ff6b03-bb3e-48ba-9389-184957e95f58\" \"MITx\" %}} by MIT\u2019s Department of Physics and is now archived on the {{% resource_link \"2042b5c1-72b2-44c3-a3b4-33d64b1ae722\" \"Open Learning Library\" %}}, which is free to use. You have the option to sign up and enroll in each module if you want to track your progress, or you can view and use all the materials without enrolling.\n",
